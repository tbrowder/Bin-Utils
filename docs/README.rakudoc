=head1 NAME

B<Bin::Utils> - Provides routines to handle 'slurp/spurt' for any file type in read/write directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use Bin::Utils;
# Get contents of a file of unknown encoding
my $from-path = "some-dir/file";
my $contents = slurp-file $from-path;
# Put contents of 'file' somewhere else
# We don't usually change the basename,
#   but we could at this point
my $basename = $from-path.IO.basename
my $dir = "another-dir/subdir";
spurt-file $contents, :$basename, :$dir";
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Bin::Utils> should be used by any module author who wants to provide
the contents of the module's /resources directory to its users. It provides the
following routines:

head2 Routines

=begin code
#| Assumes file is binary, best choice
#| if in doubt of file type
sub slurp-file(
     $path,
Bool :$bin    = True,
Bool :$utf8c8 = False,
Bool :$other  = False,
    ) is export {...}
=end code

=begin code
#| Assumes file is binary, best choice
#|   if in doubt of file type
#| Returns the new path
sub spurt-file(
    $contents,
    :$basename!,
    :$dir is copy,    #= the desired output directory
                      #= default: $*CWD ('.')
    :$bin    = True,
    :$utf8c8 = False,
    :$other  = False,
    --> IO::Path
    ) is export {...}
=end code

=begin code
#| Compares two files' binary contents
#| using the GNU system utility 'cmp'
sub bin-cmp(
    $file1, 
    $file2, 
    # cmp options
    :$s = True,  # silent
    :$l = False, # list bytes differing and their values
    :$b = False, # list bytes differing
    :$n = 0,     # list first n bytes (default: 0 - list all)
    :$debug, 
    --> List
    ) is export {...}
=end code

Note the Raku 'slurp' and 'spurt' routines have many other options
that a normal user of this simplified library would not need.
The treatment of all files as binary blobs has been shown to be
usable for files of three different encodings, including 'Str'.
